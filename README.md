# cocosynth
COCO Synth provides tools for creating synthetic COCO datasets.

# Getting Started
Check out the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide. It will walk you through the scripts with a sample dataset.

# Going Deeper
I'm working on a course for developers who'd like a step by step walk-through of how to create a synthetic COCO dataset from scratch. I'll explain all of the code in this repo so that you can modify it and use it in your own projects.
