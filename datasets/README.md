# TL;DR
This directory is intentionally empty to save space. You can put datasets here.

# More Detailed Explanation
This directory is intended to contain datasets that the scripts will access, however they are intentionally not included in the git repo to save space. You may safely leave datasets in here and the .gitignore file will ensure that they are not included in git commits.

# Datasets
Here are some datasets you can download to populate this directory.

Note: The full dataset I created was several gigabytes of 1024x1024 images so I'm not including it here. You can use this git repo to generate your own. For reference, it contained 10k training images and 1k validation images.
