# TL;DR
This directory is intentionally empty to save space. You can put datasets here.

# More Detailed Explanation
This directory is intended to contain datasets that the scripts will access, however they are intentionally not included in the git repo to save space. You may safely leave datasets in here and the .gitignore file will ensure that they are not included in git commits.

# Datasets
Here are some datasets you can download to populate this directory.
